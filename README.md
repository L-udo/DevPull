A Image Scraper for the popular Artist website "Deviantart"


This application was designed in the wake of a AI furry image generator project
hopefully i will release my contributions to this software on my github..

this application is designed to scrape through the 209 availible pages of devientart
and designed to output a file containing a list of the urls scraped for the images as well
as a folder containing the images automatically downloaded after the scraping process




only requirements for this software are:
selenium
requests


BEFORE YOU RUN DEVPULL:

CREATE A FOLDER CALLED img_out in the CWD!

THIS SOFTWARE REQUIRES YOU DOWNLOAD THE COMPATIBLE CHROMEDRIVER FOR YOUR CHROME VERSION





IF YOUR UNSURE WHAT VERSION OF CHROME YOU ARE RUNNING CLICK THE THREE DOTS AT THE TOP RIGHT OF YOUR CHROME



CLICK HELP, THEN CLICK ABOUT CHROME.



IT WILL DISPLAY YOUR CHROME VERISON AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS NAVIGATE TO:

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads



HERE YOU WILL DOWNLOAD THE MATCHING CHROME DRIVER TO YOUR CURRENT CHROME VERSION

AND AWAY YOU GO!

HAPPY SCRAPING!!!!!!!
